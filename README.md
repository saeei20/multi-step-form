Multi-Step Form Project

This project is a multi-step form built using React.js, HTML, Tailwind CSS, Unsplash images and FontAwesome icons. The form is designed to collect information from users in a step-by-step manner, ensuring a smooth and guidedÂ experience. Each step of the form presents a different set of questions or options, allowing the user to progress through the form one step at a time. The project is hosted on Netlify, ensuring easy access and deployment. React Router is used for client-side routing, enabling seamless navigation between different steps of the form. Overall, this multi-step form project showcases the power and flexibility of React.js for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces, making it ideal for a wide range of applications, from simple surveys to complex data collection forms.
